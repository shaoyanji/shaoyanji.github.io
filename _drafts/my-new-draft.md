This is my new draft.

It is written in markdown using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

The source code is a little bloaty for a blog because it isn't yet fully declarative in a nix file for a devenv.

I am considering moving my blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but I'm not sure if I want to do that yet. The theme I am currently looking at is https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter. It has a similar look and feel of chirpy.
