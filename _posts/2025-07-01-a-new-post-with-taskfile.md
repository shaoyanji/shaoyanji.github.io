## A way to integrate Taskfile with Jekyll without dependencies on local system

## local developement jsut requires tooling

### Taskfile

Taskfile is a task runner / build tool that aims to be simpler to use than Make, Rake, or Gulp.

source: [taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev)

So far I have came up with two somewhat useful commands:

```console
task mdimg -- "the prompt for image generation"
task post -- "the prompt for a new post"
```

And so far I haven't made it a template AI generated blog yet, but something simple like generating the date in the filename and maybe later chain it and then move onto the editor.

```console
date +%Y-%m-%d
```

### Neovim
Normally vim doesn't do a graceful job at inserting stdout text and requires some macros to format the text from terminal stdout. I have discovered this little gem.

```console
:redir @a
:!task mdimg -- "the prompt for image generation" 
:redir END
:0put =@a
```
As discussed in my [previous post](), I have been using this to generate images for my blog posts as I write.

## To Do

- [ ] Add a template for AI generated blog posts
- [ ] Add a template for AI generated blog post images / Perhaps a gum TUI/form
- [ ] Add a yaml header to the blog post. Jekyll has a very nice way of doing this with front matter. But much of it can be streamlined without installing `ruby` `gem` `bundler` on a native mint system. a 17 MB `task` can handle pretty much all of this.
